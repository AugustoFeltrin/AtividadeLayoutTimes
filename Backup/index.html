                <p>The host of a show where people play games for prizes. However, they hate losers,
                    and everyone who
                    loses on their show are "shunned". What happens? No one knows.
                    The only thing that is agreed on is
                    that the people who lose mysteriously disappear shortly after leaving the program,
                    in a period of a
                    few short days. They all end up as missing person signs and as materials for
                    newspapers. Fizzy, of
                    course, denies any involvement.</p>
