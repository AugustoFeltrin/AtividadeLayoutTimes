                <p class="galvao-texto">Veeti is a lovable and sweet individual, always looking to cheer
                    his friends and to please them, not hesitating to help them when they're in need,
                    even when the situation is risky. He seems to be filled with energy and has a bit
                    of a hard time staying still, and always tries to keep a smile on his face to
                    convince others that everything will be alright.</p>
